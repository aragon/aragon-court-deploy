> See the [output folder](./data/output) for information on deployed contracts on live networks

## ANJ

Make sure the related configuration is correctly set up in `./data/input/anj`

### Local

To deploy a new ANJ instance locally simply run a ganache instance and run the following deployment script:

```
npx ganache-cli -i 15 --gasLimit 7000000 --port 8545
npm run deploy:anj -- -n rpc
```

### Testnets and Mainnet

To deploy a new ANJ instance make sure everything is set in order to use `truffle-hdwallet-provider` and run:

```
npm run deploy:anj -- -n [mainnet|ropsten|rinkeby]
```

## Aragon Court

Make sure the related configuration is correctly set up in `./data/input/court`

### Local

To deploy a new Aragon Court instance locally simply run a ganache instance and run the following deployment script:

```
npx ganache-cli -i 15 --gasLimit 7000000 --port 8545
npm run deploy:court -- -n rpc
```

### Testnets and Mainnet

To deploy a new Aragon Court instance make sure everything is set in order to use `truffle-hdwallet-provider` and run:

```
npm run deploy:court -- -n [mainnet|ropsten|rinkeby]
```

## Options

- `input`: specify a custom config file
- `output`: specify an output directory for the deployed contracts information
- `verbose`: enable the logging verbose mode
- `verify`: pass an Etherscan api-key to verify your contracts

## Deployments

All `config` and `output` files under `data` directory have a suffix for the environment they belong to. Besides the common `mainnet`, `rinkeby`, `ropsten` or `rpc` ones, there are some special ones:

- `rinkeby.usability`: Environment deployed on Rinkeby to do some UX research sessions with some voluntary participants. It had a really shor term to be able to conduct those sessions within an hour, being able to do thorough tests
- `rinkeby.usability-open`: Environment deployed on Rinkeby for UX feedback too but open to all jurors activated on mainnet. Parameters are close to mainnet ones but with shorter periods for more agile testing.
